    <div class = "info"><p>Communication over electronic media has become the most common thing in mobile technology. We have different implementations of technology to help people communicate with each other on our computers, smart phones and even smart TVs.</p></div>
    <div class = "info"><p>The most commonly used mode of communication in electronic media and commonly used device is mobile phones. There are various methods of communication provided in mobile phones like SMS messaging, Email services and internet based messaging applications. As the number of users is on rise, the services and applications providing easy forms of communication are also increasing. This demand creates the necessary implementation of security standards to safeguard users from external as well as internal harmful activities. With increase in cases of intercepting calls, hacking Email, recording personal messages between two users etc., the need to provide security for communication modes is utter priority.</p></div>
    <div class = "info"><p>Sometimes securing the actual message can be beneficial and efficient than securing large scale networks by implementation of protocols. The idea to secure messages is more feasible and can be updated with time instead of implementing secure schemes over different complicated layers of communication such as network or internet. We developed an application which protects confidentiality and privacy of messages between two or more authorised parties who can access those messages.</p></div>
