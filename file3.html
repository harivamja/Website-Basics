        <br>
        <div class = "info"><p>Every user wants that the message they send should be accessed by the intended party only. We can clarify our problem statement using a simple example of Bob and Alice. Suppose Bob wants to share Alice a highly confidential message over electronic media. Bob knows that there are attackers who will try to steal that information using cyber attacks like man in the middle attacks or social engineering to retrieve the message. In the above example Bob wants a secure way of communication where he sends encrypted messages to Alice by the use of a pre-shared key agreed by both Bob and Alice. These messages can be decrypted by Alice only when she enters the key. Here even if the attacker captures the message it will be a cipher which will be hard to decrypt by the attacker.</p></div>
